Inspired by our network, connexions and partners like JungleBus with [**Accra Mobility**](https://junglebus.io/accra/#13/5.5781/-0.2432), AFD with [**Transport4Africa**](http://wiki.lafabriquedesmobilites.fr/wiki/Digital_Transport_4_Africa), CODATU and [**MobiliseYourCity**](http://wiki.lafabriquedesmobilites.fr/wiki/Mobilise_your_city), FabMob aims to empower african communities with open source assets (data, software, hardware) and to discover the huge potential of african entrepreneurs. Many projects are already developing in the fields of open data and open source software, such as [**CAFDO**](http://forum.donneesouvertes.africa/) which is starting to federate around Open Burkina, [**Digital Matatus**](http://www.digitalmatatus.com/) or [**Transport for Cairo**](http://transportforcairo.com/).

From Feb 28th to March 2nd 2018, [**FUTUR.E.S in Africa**](http://www.futuresin.africa/#about) is the first event that connects French, Moroccan and Africans digital ecosystems. FabMob will be there to join and meet innovators, thinkers and doers from start-ups, corporations, institutions and academics. A specific workshop on open data in the field of transportation ([**10 AM, March 1st at Numa Casablanca**](https://africa.futuresfestivals.com/programme/)) will be organised.

We believe that open source has many benefits for African cities, entrepreneurs, startups, laboratories and schools. It allows players to connect with each other, give them useful resources to start faster, and facilitate connexions with open interfaces. In addition, it also helps empower citizens. In return, we are convinced that African entrepreneurs, makers can inspire us with beautiful projects !

**You're interested in Mobility and Innovation, on Open Source, open data** : Come visit our fabmob stand in Casablanca on March 1st and 2nd. To get acquainted, a short **questionnaire** below will allow us to discover the actors and the projects. We will produce upon our return a complete documentation on our wiki of these meetings and this ecosystem.

**Take 5 min to complete our Questionnaire, let's empower open source communities working on transportation !**
